    hs_lambda : float, default 0.0
        Hierarchical-shrinkage strength on the leaf values. ``0`` keeps the plain

        the numeric features the tree split on (evaluated at bin centers) instead
        of a constant -- adding local slope where step leaves underfit smooth

    early_stopping : bool, default True
        Whether to use early stopping to terminate training when the validation
        score stops improving.  Requires ``early_stopping_rounds`` (defaults
        to 50 when early stopping is active but the param is None).

        Fraction of training data to hold out as a validation set when

        Bagging. ``None`` or ``1`` trains a single model. An int >= 2 trains that
        many independent members on bootstrap resamples and averages their
        predictions, which cuts variance and smooths the output (works well with
        *early_stopping*, since each member early-stops on its own bootstrap).
    ensemble_n_jobs : int, default 1

    """Gradient boosted oblivious trees for classification.

    Automatically uses binary logloss for 2 classes and softmax multiclass for
    3+. `classes_` preserves the original label values.

    hs_lambda : float, default 0.0
        Hierarchical-shrinkage strength on the leaf values. ``0`` keeps the plain
        per-leaf Newton estimate. When > 0, each leaf value is recursively shrunk
        toward its ancestors (low-mass / deep leaves hardest), a cheap post-pass
        over the finished tree that adds no inference cost. Larger = more shrinkage.

    linear_leaves : bool or None, default None
        Whether each leaf predicts a small ridge-regularized LINEAR model of the
        numeric features the tree split on (instead of a constant), adding local
        slope where step leaves underfit. ``None`` auto-enables it for BINARY
        classification (a broad Brier improvement validated on Grinsztajn +
        OpenML that survives bagging) and disables it for multiclass (unsupported).
        Pass ``True``/``False`` to force it. Below ~1000 training rows it falls
        back to constant leaves (small data overfits per-leaf slopes).
    linear_lambda : float, default 1.0
        Ridge penalty on the per-leaf linear slopes (larger = closer to constant).

    early_stopping : bool, default True
        Whether to use early stopping.  The validation split is always
        stratified to preserve class proportions; when *groups* is passed,
        ``StratifiedGroupKFold`` is used instead.
    validation_fraction : float, default 0.2
        Fraction of training data held out for the automatic validation set.
        Ignored when an explicit *eval_set* is given to ``fit``.
    n_ensembles : int or None, default None
        Bagging. ``None`` or ``1`` trains a single model. An int >= 2 trains that
        many independent members on bootstrap resamples and averages their
        (temperature-calibrated) class probabilities, which cuts variance and
        smooths the output.
    ensemble_n_jobs : int, default 1
        Processes used to fit ensemble members in parallel (1 = sequential).
        When >1 and *thread_count* is None, numba threads are split among workers.
