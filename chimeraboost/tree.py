"""Oblivious (symmetric) decision trees, numba-accelerated.

An oblivious tree of depth D uses the SAME (feature, bin-threshold) split at
every node of a given level. A row's leaf is therefore just a D-bit number, one
bit per level: bit_d = 1 if X[feature_d] > threshold_d else 0. This makes:

  * prediction a handful of comparisons + an array lookup (very fast), and
  * the model strongly regularized (only D splits per tree, shared across the
    whole level), which is a big part of why the defaults don't overfit.

We grow level by level. At each level we build per-(feature, current-leaf, bin)
gradient/hessian histograms and pick the single split that maximizes the summed
XGBoost-style gain over all current leaves.
