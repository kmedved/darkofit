"""Oblivious (symmetric) decision trees, numba-accelerated.

An oblivious tree of depth D uses the SAME (feature, bin-threshold) split at
every node of a given level. A row's leaf is therefore just a D-bit number, one
bit per level: bit_d = 1 if X[feature_d] > threshold_d else 0. This makes:

  * prediction a handful of comparisons + an array lookup (very fast), and
  * the model strongly regularized (only D splits per tree, shared across the
    whole level), which is a big part of why the defaults don't overfit.

We grow level by level. At each level we build per-(feature, current-leaf, bin)
gradient/hessian histograms and pick the single split that maximizes the summed
XGBoost-style gain over all current leaves.

    local gradient noise -- are pulled hardest toward the smoother parent; large,
    high-signal leaves keep their sharp value. See Agarwal et al., ICML 2022.

    Oblivious trees are perfectly symmetric, so leaf ``j`` at depth D and its
    coarser ancestors form a complete binary tree under ``parent(j) = j >> 1``.
    We lay that tree out heap-style (root 0, children of i at 2i+1/2i+2; the
