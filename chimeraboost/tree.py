"""Oblivious (symmetric) decision trees, numba-accelerated.

An oblivious tree of depth D uses the SAME (feature, bin-threshold) split at
every node of a given level. A row's leaf is therefore just a D-bit number, one
bit per level: bit_d = 1 if X[feature_d] > threshold_d else 0. This makes:

  * prediction a handful of comparisons + an array lookup (very fast), and
  * the model strongly regularized (only D splits per tree, shared across the
    whole level), which is a big part of why the defaults don't overfit.

We grow level by level. At each level we build per-(feature, current-leaf, bin)
gradient/hessian histograms and pick the single split that maximizes the summed
XGBoost-style gain over all current leaves.

    Instead of estimating every leaf independently (``_leaf_values``), each
    leaf's Newton value is recursively shrunk toward its ancestors' values, with
    the shrinkage strength set by ``hs_lambda`` and damped by the node's hessian
    mass (a sample-count proxy). Low-mass / deep leaves -- the ones that overfit
    local gradient noise -- are pulled hardest toward the smoother parent; large,
    high-signal leaves keep their sharp value. See Agarwal et al., ICML 2022.

    Oblivious trees are perfectly symmetric, so leaf ``j`` at depth D and its
    coarser ancestors form a complete binary tree under ``parent(j) = j >> 1``.
    We lay that tree out heap-style (root 0, children of i at 2i+1/2i+2; the
    2**D leaves occupy [n_leaves-1, 2*n_leaves-1)), aggregate grad/hess upward,

    bit-identical to ``_leaf_values`` at hs_lambda=0 (different op order), so the

    the per-tree Shapley values are computed by exact enumeration over subsets of
    the distinct ORIGINAL features the tree uses. This is tractable precisely
    because the trees are oblivious: a depth-D tree touches at most D distinct
    features, so the coalition game has at most D players (<=2**D subsets), not
    one per input column. A feature in coalition S takes its value from x, the
    rest from r; the leaf -- and any linear-leaf slope term -- is evaluated under
    that mix, so the linear leaves are explained faithfully rather than ignored.

    Contributions are averaged over the background and summed over trees, giving
    for every instance the Shapley-efficiency identity (to float tolerance)

    feature_mask: optional 0/1 array over features; 0 disables a feature for
    this tree (column subsampling). None means all features are eligible.
    min_child_weight: minimum hessian mass each side of a split must retain in
    every non-empty leaf. Stops the tree growing once no legal split remains,
    which prevents sparse-leaf overfitting at higher depth.
    hist_buffers: optional interleaved buffer of shape (n_features,
    2**max_depth, max_bins, 2) reused across trees to avoid per-level
    allocation. If None, it is allocated here (for one-off calls and tests).
    hs_lambda: hierarchical-shrinkage strength for the leaf values (0 = off,
    the plain per-leaf Newton estimate). When > 0, leaf values are shrunk
    toward their ancestors via `_leaf_values_hs` as a cheap post-pass over the
    finished structure (the split search is unaffected).
    linear_leaves: when True, attach a per-leaf ridge linear model over the
    tree's numeric split features (`centers_std`/`is_numeric` required;
    `linear_lambda` is the slope penalty). Low-count leaves fall back to the
    constant Newton value. The split search is unaffected.
    constant_hessian: when True, histogram fill treats every scanned row's
    Hessian as exactly 1. Only valid for unweighted, unsubsampled constant-
    Hessian losses.
    feature_indices: optional selected feature columns matching `feature_mask`;
    lets column-subsampled fits skip histogram work for masked-out features.
    row_indices: optional selected training rows; lets subsampled fits skip
    histogram work for zero-weighted rows while keeping full-length grad/hess
    arrays for the training update.
    split_search: internal benchmark/test selector. "auto" uses the default
    fast full-data catboost lane where applicable, "legacy" forces the original
    split kernel, and "v2" forces the leaf-streaming split kernel.
