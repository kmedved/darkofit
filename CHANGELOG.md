# Changelog

## Unreleased

* Expose `auto_params_` on fitted boosters and preserve it through `.npz`
  serialization. The metadata records resolved learning rate, effective sample
  size, feature counts, tree sizing, regularization, binning, early stopping,
  sampling, and threading context from the last fit.
* Make numeric bin construction respect non-uniform `sample_weight` through
  weighted quantile borders. `sample_weight=None` and all-ones weights keep the
  previous unweighted behavior.
* Add sklearn-wrapper refit helpers: `get_refit_params()`, selected-round and
  resolved-learning-rate properties, and optional `refit=True` full-data refits
  after early-stopping selection.
