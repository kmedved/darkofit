# chimeraboost
Full-featured gradient boosting library with a Python/numba backend, inspired by CatBoost.

* **What?**
    * GBDT library that only depends on numpy, numba, and scikit-learn
    * Near equivalent performance to CatBoost on CPU (~97% R^2 / F1 in benchmarks), at 20x the speed
    * Supports sample weights and automatic early stopping

* **Why?**
    * I want to be able to modify my GBDT library at will
    * I know Python and I don't know C

* **How?**

```
# pip install chimeraboost

from chimeraboost import ChimeraBoostClassifier
clf = ChimeraBoostClassifier(early_stopping=True)
clf.fit(X, y, sample_weight=w)
```

Tree builders are selectable:

```
ChimeraBoostClassifier(tree_mode="catboost")  # symmetric/oblivious default
ChimeraBoostClassifier(tree_mode="lightgbm")  # level-wise, non-oblivious
```



* **To Do:**
    * Update multi-class classification loss scheme
