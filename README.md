* What?
    * GBDT library that only depends on numpy and numba
    * Near equivalent performance to CatBoost on CPU

* Why?
    * I want to be able to modify my GBDT library at will
    * I know Python and I don't know C

* How?


```
from chimeraboost import ChimeraBoostClassifier
clf = ChimeraBoostClassifier()
clf.fit(X, y)
```
